- **Text-to-Speech**: Responds verbally to user queries using the `pyttsx3` library.
- **Time and Date Information**: Can provide the current time and date upon request.
- **Web Search**: Conducts web searches based on user commands.
- **Wikipedia Queries**: Fetches and summarizes articles from Wikipedia.
- **User-Friendly Interaction**: Continuously listens for commands and provides appropriate responses.
